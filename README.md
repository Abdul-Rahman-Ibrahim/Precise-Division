# Division with Precision

This Python project provides a function to perform division between two numbers (`n1` and `n2`) with a specified level of precision (`p`). The division is done manually, digit by digit, and ensures that the result matches the given precision.

## Features

- Divides two floating-point numbers.
- Allows the user to specify the number of decimal places (precision).
- Handles cases like division by zero.
- Ensures that the result is displayed with the exact number of decimal places, adding trailing zeros if necessary.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
